# VillagerUnknown's Lucky Coins for Villager Coin

_This is an addon mod for Villager Coin._

Adds a variety of lucky Copper, Iron, Gold, Emerald, and Netherite coins to Villager Coin that apply beneficial status effects when in a player's inventory.

Lucky coins, like collectable coins, can be traded with other players in your world, put on display in your base, or converted to the common Villager Coins of equal value through the crafting table for trading with Villagers.

Lucky coins are valuable coins, rarer than common Villager Coins, with limited quantities in circulation that apply a status effect when in a player's inventory.
